## Moderation Policy

If you are not a member of the JS Foundation owned GitHub Organization in
question and wish to submit a moderation request, please see
[Requesting Moderation](#requesting-moderation)

* [Applicability](#applicability)
* [Terms](#terms)
* [Grounds for Moderation](#grounds-for-moderation)

### Applicability

By default, the [JS Foundation Code of Conduct][] defines the moderation
process of reported Code of Conduct violations. This policy applies to all
repositories under the ownership of the JS Foundation and all JS Foundation
Working Groups.

Working Groups chartered by the TAC may adopt an alternative Moderation Policy
for any repository under their stewardship so long as:
* The Moderation Policy is openly documented as part of the Working Group
Charter and;
* It includes provisions for clearly and openly documenting Moderation actions
taken.

If a particular repository can be considered to fall under the stewardship of
multiple Working Groups that have adopted different Moderation Policies, they
can choose to either:
* Decide between themselves which Moderation Policy will be in effect for the
repository in question, or
* Ask the TAC to determine which Moderation Policy should apply.

Any alternative Moderation Policy used for a given repository must be included
in the root directory of the repository using the `Moderation-Policy.md`
filename. If a repository does not contain a `Moderation-Policy.md` file,
then this default policy applies.

### Terms

* *Collaborator* refers to any individual with configured access permissions to
any JS Foundation owned GitHub organization or repository. See
[GitHub's access permissions documentation][] for more information.
* *TAC* refers to the [JS Foundation Technical Advisory Committee][].
* *Post* refers to the content and titles of any issue, pull request, comment or
wiki page.
* *Moderate* refers to the act of modifying the content and title of, or
deleting, any Post for the purpose of correcting or addressing Code of Conduct
violations.
* *Ban* refers to the act of blocking an individual GitHub account from any
further participation in a JS Foundation owned GitHub organization or
repository.
* *Requester* refers to an individual requesting Moderation on a Post.

### Grounds for Moderation

Any Post considered to be in violation of the
[JS Foundation Code of Conduct][] is subject to Moderation.

The [Code of Conduct Committee][] is solely responsible for deciding what
constitutes inappropriate behavior that may be subject to Moderation (see:
[Escalation to the CoC Committee][]). The CoC Committee may, if necessary, ask
the JS Foundation Board of Directors for a resolution if consensus can not
be reached.

### Requesting Moderation

Anyone may request Moderation of a Post. Requesting Moderation of a Post can be
accomplished in one of three ways:

* Via the [conduct@js.foundation][] email address,
* Via private email to individual CoC Committee members,
* Via a new Post in the same thread as the Post being requested for Moderation.

Note that Collaborators may Moderate non-Collaborator Posts at any time without
submitting an initial request (see: [Non-Collaborator Posts][]).

Use of the [conduct@js.foundation][] email address -- or private email to
individual CoC Committee members -- is appropriate when the individual
requesting the Moderation does not feel comfortable directly or publicly making
the request. All emails sent to the [conduct@js.foundation][] address are forwarded
to all members of the CoC Committee.

Requests for Moderation that do not appear to have been submitted in good faith
with intent to address a legitimate Code of Conduct violation, as determined by
the CoC Committee, may be ignored.

### Consideration of Intent

Before Moderating a Post, Collaborators should carefully consider the possible
intent of the author. It may be that the author has simply made an error or is
not yet familiar with the [JS Foundation Code of Conduct][]; or it may be
that cultural differences exist, or that the author is unaware that certain
content is considered inappropriate. In such cases, the author should be given
an opportunity to correct any error that may have been made.

Note, however, that unfamiliarity with the [JS Foundation Code of Conduct][]
does not excuse a Post from Moderation.

### Guidelines and Requirements

* All Posts are expected to respect the [JS Foundation Code of Conduct][].
* Only Collaborators with commit rights to a given repository may Moderate Posts
within that repository's issue tracker.
* The CoC Committee, or in very rare cases the Board of Directors, serves as the
final arbiter for all Moderation issues (see:
[Escalation to the CoC Committee][]).
* Only a TAC or Board of Directors member may Ban an individual from a JS
Foundation owned GitHub organization or repository.
* Any individual Banned from a JS Foundation owned GitHub organization or
repository will be recommended for exclusion from any JS Foundation
sponsored event or activity.
* Minor edits to the formatting of a Post or to correct typographical errors are
not considered to be "Moderation". Such edits and their intent should still be
documented with a short note indicating who made the edit and why.

#### Collaborator Posts

* Collaborators must not Moderate any Post authored by another Collaborator
without first giving the author at least 24 hours (from the time of the initial
request) to modify or remove the Post on their own.
* If the author of the Post disagrees that Moderation is required, the matter
can be resolved by [Escalation to the CoC Committee][]. In such cases, no
Moderation action should be taken until a decision by the CoC Committee is made.
* In extreme circumstances involving either obvious gross violations of the
[JS Foundation Code of Conduct][] or possible compromise of a Collaborator's
GitHub account, the CoC Committee can be consulted to waive the 24 hour grace
period and dispute process.

When Moderating any Post authored by another Collaborator, the moderating
Collaborator must:
* Explain the justification for Moderating the post,
* Identify all changes made to the Post, and
* Identify the steps previously taken to resolve the issue.

Explanations of Moderation actions on Collaborator Posts must be provided in:
* A new post within the original thread, ***or***
* A message to [conduct@js.foundation][].

Any Collaborator who habitually authors Posts that must be Moderated can be
Banned from further participation in the JS Foundation owned GitHub
organizations or repositories for an indefinite period of time.

#### Non-Collaborator Posts

Posts authored by non-Collaborators are always subject to immediate Moderation
by any Collaborator if the content is intentionally disruptive or in violation
of the [JS Foundation Code of Conduct][].

When Moderating non-Collaborator Posts, the moderating Collaborator should:
* Explain the justification for Moderating the post, and
* Identify all changes made to the Post.

If an explanation of a Moderation action for a non-Collaborator Post is
provided, it should be provided in:
* The original Post being modified (as replacement or appended content),
***or***
* A new post within the original thread, ***or***
* A message to [conduct@js.foundation][].

Moderation of Posts authored by non-Collaborators may result in those
non-Collaborators being Banned from further participation in the JS Foundation
owned GitHub organization or repository for an indefinite period of time.

In the case where a GitHub Account appears to have been created with no
intention to collaborate in good faith, swift actions may be taken without
following the above procedures including: removing Posts, Banning, and reporting
accounts to GitHub.

Note that Moderating non-Collaborator posts can often lead to retaliation or
escalation of inappropriate behavior by the individual whose post is being
Moderated. This is true primarily of individuals whose intent is to harass,
disrupt or annoy individual members of the community. In such cases, it is best
to handle the Moderation as quickly and as quietly as possible without drawing
any further undue attention to the Post in question.

### Escalation to the CoC Committee

Any Moderation issue or dispute can be escalated to the CoC Committee by
sending a message to [conduct@js.foundation][].

All Moderation-related decisions follow the processes defined in the
[JS Foundation Code of Conduct][].

Code of Conduct Committee members directly involved in a Moderation issue -- as
either the Requester or author of the Post in question -- are expected to excuse
themselves from any decisions required to resolve the issue.

### Modifications to This Policy

Modifications to this policy are made through normal [TAC motion and vote][].
Any Collaborator may submit a PR proposing changes to this policy. Those PRs
must be labeled using the `TAC-agenda` label.
