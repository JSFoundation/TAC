# Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) Charter

## Section 1. Guiding Principle.

The Technical Advisory Committee operates transparently, openly,
collaboratively, and ethically. Project proposals, timelines, and status must
not merely be open, but also easily visible to outsiders.

## Section 2. Evolution of jQuery Foundation Governance

Most large, complex open source communities have both a business and a technical
governance model. jQuery Foundation's technical leadership contains a Technical
Advisory Committee ("TAC"), Collaboration Boards ("CB"s), Working Groups ("WG"s)
and Projects which may represent a single or collection of code bases. jQuery
Foundation's business leadership is instantiated in a Board of Directors (the
"Board”).

This Technical Advisory Committee Charter reflects a balanced role for the TAC
and the Board in the governance of the jQuery Foundation. The charter amendment
process is for the TAC to propose changes using simple majority of the full TAC,
the proposed changes being subject to review and approval by the Board. The
Board may additionally make amendments to the TAC charter at any time, though
the Board does not interfere with day-to-day discussions, votes or meetings of
the TAC.

## Section 3. Board's Role in Setting jQuery Foundation's Strategic Direction

The Board sets the overall TAC policy through [Foundation mission and vision
statements][] as well as within the [Foundation bylaws][]. The policy describes
the overarching scope of the jQuery Foundation initiatives , technical vision,
and direction. The Board uses the TAC as a delegate body for governing
high-level technical policy and procedures while remaining within the scope and
direction of the policies set by the Board.

## Section 4. Establishment of the TAC

TAC memberships are time-limited to 1 year terms with no limit on the number of
terms a member may serve. The TAC will be limited to 25 voting seats and
membership of the TAC will consist of:

1. One representative from each Collaboration Board.
2. One representative from each jQuery Foundation Platinum Member organization.
3. One representative from the Node.js Foundation. See the [Ecosystem
Mentorship][] section below for details concerning the relationship between the
jQuery Foundation and the Node.js Foundation.
4. Individuals from the greater JS community as appointed by the existing TAC
and the Board.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for TAC membership
beyond these rules. The TAC and the Board may add additional members from the JS
community to the TAC by  following the election process as described in the
[Elections][] section of this charter. A TAC member, including those appointed
by Projects and Member organizations may be removed from the TAC by voluntary
resignation, or by a standard TAC motion and vote. If the removed member is a
Project or Member organization representative, that Project or Member
organization may appoint a new representative. The removed member may again be
considered for addition to the TAC after a term of 1 year from their removal. At
the end of a member's term, that term may be renewed for an additional term by a
standard TAC motion and vote.

Changes to TAC membership should be posted in the TAC meeting agenda, and may be
suggested as any other agenda item.

No more than one-fourth of the TAC members may be affiliated with the same
employer. If removal or resignation of a TAC member, or a change of employment
by a TAC member, creates a situation where more than one-fourth of the TAC
membership shares an employer, then the situation must be immediately remedied
by the resignation or removal of one or more TAC members affiliated with the
over-represented employer(s) or the addition of a new representative not
affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).

The TAC shall meet regularly using tools that enable participation by the
community (e.g. quarterly on a Google Hangout On Air, or through any other
appropriate means selected by the TAC). The meeting shall be directed by the TAC
Chairperson. Minutes or an appropriate recording shall be taken and made
available to the community through accessible public postings.

## Section 5. Responsibilities and Expectations of the TAC

Subject to such policies as may be set by the Board, the TAC is responsible for
ensuring collaboration is the driving principle within a Project, between jQuery
Foundation Projects, and between jQuery Foundation Projects and the broader
community. The TAC is also responsible for admitting new projects to the
mentorship program as well as graduating projects from the mentorship program.
The TAC is also responsible for mediating technical conflicts between jQuery
Foundation Projects when attempts to resolve those conflicts within the Project
and its CB were unsuccessful. The TAC serves as the jQuery Foundation's primary
technical liaison body with external open source projects, consortiums and
groups and is also responsible for technical participation in standards bodies.
Members of the TAC, or committees consisting of subsets of the TAC membership
will be expected to meet on a regular basis to discuss topics such as new
project acceptance into the mentorship program, project graduation from the
mentorship program, Project and CB issues and conflicts, opportunities for
collaboration between Projects, opportunities for the Foundation in the greater
JavaScript community, etc.

## Section 6. Ecosystem Mentorship

The jQuery Foundation administers a mentorship program through which projects
may enter the Foundation and through this program, it will support these
projects in their efforts to implement policies and instill values that foster
contribution and collaboration from a larger and more diverse set of individuals
and organizations. The goal of this mentorship program is to ensure that
projects are well maintained and supported for the long term and are welcoming
environments that encourage participation. In order to best serve the entire
JavaScript ecosystem, the jQuery Foundation will formally partner with the
Node.js Foundation to guide the mentorship program. In order to facilitate this
partnership, the Node.js Foundation will have representation on the TAC as
described in the [Establishment of the TAC][] section above and will provide
project mentors as they become available

## Section 7. Responsibilities and Expectations of CBs

Collaboration Boards act in a similar role, have similar expectations and
provide the same types of policy guidance and reviews as the TAC but with a
focus on a specific subset of Projects and their members are represented by
individuals familiar with the Projects forming that CB. For those CBs that
support multiple Projects, those Projects may be related in a number of
different ways including technology, problem space, business vertical, etc but
have some overlapping concern that allows them the ability to share a set of
base policies and/or seek opportunities for collaboration. CBs will ensure that
Projects follow the lifecycle process as described in the [Project Lifecycle][]
document. CBs will occasionally review and recommend changes to the lifecycle of
a Project, which will include consideration of the following criteria:

* Cleanliness of the code base;
* Ample and diverse Contributors and Collaborators to assure vitality of
the project;
* Stability (e.g. presence of test suites, stable APIs and use of an
appropriate source-code control system);
* Predictability of releases;
* Alignment with the jQuery Foundation's goals and priorities.

The CBs, Projects and the entire technical community will follow any processes
as may be specified by the Board relating to the intake and license compliance
review of contributions, including the jQuery Foundation CLA and IP Policy.

## Section 8. Responsibilities and Expectations of Projects

jQuery Foundation Projects are self-governing entities. All policies and
procedures for interacting with, contributing to and making decisions within a
Project are defined, implemented, and documented by that Project’s maintainers
and community during the mentorship process. Specific technical decisions within
a Project will be the responsibility of the Project and if the project is a
member of a CB, establishment and implementation of the decision making process
will be done within the guidelines as defined by that CB charter. Those Project
decisions and responsibilities include but are not limited to:

* Setting release dates.
* Release quality standards.
* Technical direction.
* Project governance and process.
* GitHub repository hosting.
* Conduct guidelines.
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators.
* Development process and any coding standards.
* Mediating technical conflicts between Collaborators.

The CBs, Projects and the entire technical community will follow any processes
as may be specified by the Board relating to the intake and license compliance
review of contributions, including the jQuery Foundation CLA and IP Policy.

## Section 9. Decision Making

For internal Project decisions, Collaborators shall operate under Lazy
Consensus. The CB for a Project or group of Projects shall establish
appropriate guidelines for implementing Lazy Consensus (e.g. expected
notification and review time periods) within the development process.

The CBs and TAC follow a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model. When an
agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does
anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a CB/TAC member can call for either a
closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting. Votes shall
follow the procedure described in the [Voting][] section of this charter.

## Section 10. Voting

Voting should only be used when consensus cannot be reached through usual
collaborative processes or in the case of elections as described in the
[Elections][] section of this charter. The call for a vote must be seconded by
2 members of the CB/TAC or else the discussion and attempt to reach consensus
will continue. Simple majority wins a vote, with the following exceptions, which
will require the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the CB/TAC to
pass:

* Adding or removing members of the CB or TAC
* Changes to the CB charter which also requires TAC approval
* Changes to the TAC charter which also requires Board approval

## Section 11. Elections

Leadership roles in the jQuery Foundation's technical organization will be peer
elected representatives of the community.

For election of persons (TAC members, TAC Chairperson, CB members, Maintainers,
etc.) a multiple-candidate method should be used, e.g.:

* [Condorcet][] or
* [Single Transferable Vote][]

Multiple-candidate methods may be reduced to simple election by plurality when
there are only two candidates for one position to be filled. No election is
required if there is only one candidate and no objections to the candidate's
election.

Each CB may elect one representative to the TAC and that representative may be
anyone from the project communities represented by that CB. Each Project may
elect a proportionate number of CB representatives to the other Projects in
their CB. Elections shall be done within the Projects by the Collaborators
active in the Project.

Foundation supporting Member organizations may elect representatives to the
TAC and may use whatever means they deem fit to determine the individuals who
will fill those roles in accordance with the limits set forth in the
[Establishment of the TAC][] section above.

The TAC will elect from amongst voting TAC members a TAC Chairperson to work on
building an agenda for TAC meetings and represent the TAC to the Board of
Directors for a term of one year according to the jQuery Foundation's By-laws.
The TAC shall hold annual elections to select a TAC Chairperson; there are no
limits on the number of terms a TAC Chairperson may serve.

## Section 12. Project Roles

The jQuery Foundation Project repositories are maintained by the Projects, their
CB and additional Collaborators who are added by the Project on an ongoing
basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions, “Contributor(s)”, are
made Collaborators and given commit-access to the Project. These individuals are
identified by the existing Collaborators for the Project and their addition as
Collaborators is discussed during Project meetings. Modifications of the
contents of the git repository are made on a collaborative basis as defined in
the development process.

Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial modifications, or
modifications that have not found consensus to the CB for discussion by
assigning the `CB-agenda` tag to a pull request or issue. The CB should serve as
the final arbiter where required. The Project will maintain and publish a list
of current Collaborators, as well as a development process guide, within the
guidelines set forth in the Project's CB charter, for Collaborators and
Contributors looking to participate in the development effort.

## Section 13. Definitions

**Project**: a technical collaboration effort that is organized through the
project mentorship process and approved by the TAC.

**Contributors**: contribute code or other artifacts, but do not have the right
to commit to the code base. Contributors work with the Project's Collaborators
to have code committed to the code base. A Contributor may be promoted to a
Collaborator by the Project's Maintainers or CB. Contributors should rarely be
encumbered by the CB and never by the TAC nor Board.

**Collaborator**: a Contributor within a Project that has made significant and
valuable contributions and has been given commit-access to that Project
repository.

**Maintainer**: a Collaborator within a Project elected to represent the Project
on the CB or other official role as defined in the Project's governance
policies.
