# The jQuery Foundation Collaboration Board

The jQuery Foundation Collaboration Board (CB) and Technical Steering Committees
(TSC) are the technical governing body of the jQuery Foundation. The goals of
this technical structure are to:

1. **Separate the business aspects from the technical aspects of the
Foundation.**  
The Executive Director, Board of Directors and others under their direction
focus on fundraising and strategic goals for the Foundation. The goal here is to
create a project-oriented structure to provide help and mentorship to projects.

2. **Establish a set of best practices for sustaining open source projects.**  
This organization should create sample policies that provide guide rails and
suggestions. Projects know their communities best and can tailor these practices
to ensure their projects are sustainable.

3. **Separate policy review from writing code and running a project.**  
There will often be overlap in the people reviewing policies and those writing
code or running a project. A separate process within the organization structure
that focuses on policy review lets them take a step back and review the
projectâ€™s overall health.

4. **Have an independent group acting as an advocate for the project
community.**  
From the inside of a single project, it is often difficult to see opportunities
for collaboration or know when the project has run into problems that could be
solved by outside assistance. A group with a wider perspective can help.

5. **Tailor involvement with the Foundation to fit project needs.**  
Some projects have chosen the Foundation primarily to hold mature code bases
that need few changes. Others are looking for help in managing growing code and
communities. These projects have different needs and the Foundation wants to
accommodate both.

The CB also admits all Projects into the jQuery Foundation as well as charters
all TSCs and Working Groups (WG). It also elects a representative to the jQuery
Foundation Board of Directors.

For more details read the [CB Charter][] adopted by the jQuery Foundation Board
of Directors on <<INSERT DATE>>.

If your project is interested in joining the jQuery Foundation please read the
[Project Lifecycle.md][] documentation.

## CB Members

CB members are responsible for top level technical community concerns and
promoting collaboration both within and among the many projects in the jQuery
Foundation. The role is mostly administrative and is responsible for advocating
the needs of the technical side of the Foundation to the jQuery Foundation Board
of Directors.

Candidates for membership in the CB tend to be people who have a competency for
community management and a high tolerance and patience for process minutiae as
the CB delegates most of its responsibilities to other Projects, TSCs and
Working Groups.

TSCs can appoint someone to the CB who they elect at their own discretion from
their membership. The number of CB members, term lengths and additional
information can be found in the [CB Charter][].

### Mentors
Project mentorship is not a technical role. In fact, mentors are discouraged
from giving technical advice to Projects. Instead, the purpose of mentorship is
to encourage and improve a Project's ability to be participatory, transparent,
and effective. Mentors are there to help Projects adopt and iterate on policies
and processes that achieve these goals and eventually allow them to graduate the
mentorship phase.

### [Working Groups][]

## Policy Change Proposal Process

The jQuery Foundation CB is chartered, subject to such policies as may be set by
the Board of Directors, to ensure collaboration is the driving principle within
a Project, between jQuery Foundation Projects, and between jQuery Foundation
Projects and the broader community. The CB is also responsible for chartering
TSCs and WGs as well as mediating technical conflicts between jQuery Foundation
Projects. TSCs and Working Groups have broad powers of self-governance.

To propose a change or addition to policies or processes that are intended to
cover all Projects and Working Groups in the Foundation, a PR should be opened
in the `jquery-foundation/CB` repository.

The pull request can be labeled `CB-agenda` to request that it be put on the
agenda for the next CB meeting.

The jQuery Foundation Board of Directors retains certain rights (especially
legal considerations). If the CB endorses a proposal, they will escalate to the
jQuery Foundation Board of Directors when required to do so.

In some cases, existing individual groups have the right to refuse changes to
their charters. The CB can not mandate that existing working groups alter their
charters. If such a situation arises, the CB may decide to revoke the group's
charter.

## Org Charts
To illustrate the structure of the jQuery Foundation's governance and technical
leadership, we have created a [General Org Strucutre Overview][] chart and will
add a Detailed Technical Org Structure chart once complete for reference.
