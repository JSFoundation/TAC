## Establishing a new Working Group

A Working Group (WG) is established by first
defining a charter that can be ratified by the Technical Advisory Committee
(TAC). A charter is a *statement of purpose*, a *list of responsibilities* and a
*list of initial membership*. A WG needs at least 3 initial members. These
should be individuals already undertaking the work described in the charter.

The list of responsibilities should be specific. The only recourse the TAC has
over a WG is to revoke the entire charter and take on the work previously done
by the working group themselves. If any of the responsibilities described in the
charter are currently undertaken by another WG then the charter will
additionally have to be ratified by that WG.

You can submit a WG charter for ratification by sending a Pull Request to
the TAC's WORKING_GROUPS.md document. The WG is considered to be chartered once
that PR lands. Once ratified the list of members should be maintained in the
WG's README.

### Base Policies for new Working Groups

Once the TAC ratifies a charter, the new WG inherits the policies established by
the TAC for governance, contribution, conduct and an APACHE 2.0 LICENSE. New WGs
are free to change these documents through their own governance process but
should retain at least the spirit of the original versions. The documents and
templates in this directory are provided to help bootstrap that process:

* [Code of Conduct][]
* [Moderation Policy][]
