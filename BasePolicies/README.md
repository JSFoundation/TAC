## Establishing a new Collaboration Board or Working Group

A Collaboration Board (CB) or Working Group (WG) is established by first
defining a charter that can be ratified by the Technical Advisory Committee
(TAC). A charter is a *statement of purpose*, a *list of responsibilities* and a
*list of initial membership*.

A WG needs at least 3 initial members while a CB's initial membership is
determined by the number of Projects involved and is defined in the CB's
Governance.md. These should be individuals already undertaking the work
described in the charter.

The list of responsibilities should be specific. The only recourse the TAC has
over a WG is to revoke the entire charter and take on the work previously done
by the working group themselves. The only recourse the TAC has over a CB is to
revoke the entire charter and either move the projects into other CB(s), into
the At-large Projects or back into mentorship when necessary.

If the responsibilities described in the charter are currently undertaken by
another CB or WG then the charter will additionally have to be ratified by that
CB or WG.

You can submit a CB or WG charter for ratification by sending a Pull Request to
the TAC's README.md for new CBs while new WGs send a Pull Request to the TAC's
WORKING_GROUPS.md document. The CB or WG is considered to be chartered once that
PR lands. Once ratified the list of members should be maintained in the CB's or
WG's README.

### Base Policies for new Collaboration Boards and Working Groups

Once the TAC ratifies a charter, the new CB or WG inherits the policies
established by the TAC for governance, contribution, conduct and an MIT LICENSE.
New CBs and WGs are free to change these documents through their own governance
process but should retain at least the spirit of the original versions. The
documents and templates in this directory are provided to help bootstrap that
process:
