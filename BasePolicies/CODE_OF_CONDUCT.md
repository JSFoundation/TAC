## Collaboration Board, Working Group and Project Code of Conduct

Every Collaboration Board (CB), Working Group (WG) or other defined governing
body must have a Code of Conduct. By default, all repositories under the jQuery
Foundation owned GitHub organizations fall under the
[jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct][], but CBs, WGs and other defined governing
bodies can choose to define their own alternative policy. If the governing body
does choose it's own Code of Conduct, it must be documented in a
`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file located in the root of any repository under their
stewardship.

Note that the Code of Conduct adopted by any governing body will be evaluated by
the TAC prior to ratifying the proposed charter. If that Code of Conduct is
considered to be weaker than, or diverges too significantly from, the
[jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct][], the TAC may defer accepting the charter
until corrections are made.

Likewise, if the Code of Conduct changes after the governing body has already
been chartered and the TAC determines that the updated Code of Conduct is weaker
than, or diverges too significantly from, the
[jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct][], the TAC or any Collaborator may request
that further corrections be made by opening an issue or a PR in the governing
body's repository. Should the governing body choose not to adopt the recommended
changes, the governing body's charter may be revoked.
