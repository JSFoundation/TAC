# JS Foundation Community Contributing Guide 1.0

This document describes a very simple process suitable for most projects in the
JS Foundation ecosystem. Projects are encouraged to adopt this whether they
are hosted in the JS Foundation or not.

The goal of this document is to create a contribution process that:

* Encourages new contributions.
* Encourages contributors to remain involved.
* Avoids unnecessary processes and bureaucracy whenever possible.
* Creates a transparent decision making process which makes it clear how
contributors can be involved in decision making.

## Vocabulary

* A **Contributor** is any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull
request.
* A **Committer** is a subset of contributors who have been given write
access to the repository.

# Logging Issues

Log an issue for any question or problem you might have. When in doubt, log an
issue, any additional policies about what to include will be provided in the
responses. The only exception is security disclosures which should be sent
privately.

Committers may direct you to another repository, ask for additional
clarifications, and add appropriate metadata before the issue is addressed.

Please be courteous, respectful, and every participant is expected to follow the
Project's Code of Conduct.

# Contributions

Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests. This
applies to all changes to documentation, code, binary files, etc. Even long term
committers and TAC members must use pull requests.

No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.

For non-trivial contributions, pull requests should sit for at least 36 hours to
ensure that contributors in other time zones have time to review. Consideration
should also be given to weekends and other holiday periods to ensure active
committers all have reasonable time to become involved in the discussion and
review process if they wish.

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no committer has
an objection and it is determined the contributor has signed the
[JS Foundation CLA][]. During review, committers may also request that a
specific contributor who is most versed in a particular area gives a "LGTM"
before the PR can be merged. There is no additional "sign off" process for
contributions to land. Once all issues brought by committers are addressed it
can be landed by any committer.

In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another committer,
all involved committers should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of
addressing concerns being expressed by discussion, compromise on the proposed
change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.

If a contribution is controversial and committers cannot agree about how to get
it to land or if it should land then it should be escalated to the TAC. It is
expected that only a small minority of issues be brought to the TAC for
resolution and that discussion and compromise among Committers be the default
resolution mechanism.

# Becoming a Committer

All Contributors who land a non-trivial contribution should be on-boarded in a
timely manner, and added as a Committer, and be given write access to the
repository.

Committers are expected to follow this policy and continue to send pull
requests, go through proper review, and have other Committers merge their pull
requests.
