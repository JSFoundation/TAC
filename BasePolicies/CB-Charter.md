## Collaboration Board Charter Template

Every Collaboration Board (CB) requires a charter that describes the scope of
the CB's responsibilities. Once written, new CBs send a Pull Request that adds
the charter to the Technical Advisory Committee's (TAC) README.md. The CB is
considered to be officially chartered once the PR adding the proposed charter is
landed and merged into the relevant document.

### Template: *[insert CB name]*

The *[insert CB name]* is jointly governed by an elected group of members that
is responsible for high-level guidance of this project or set of projects.

The CB has final authority over:

* Governance and process (including this policy)
* Contribution policy
* Conduct guidelines
* Conflict resolution

For the current list of CB members, see the [README.md][].

### Membership

CB seats are not time-limited. There is no fixed size of the CB. However, the
expected target is between 3 and 6, to ensure adequate coverage of important
areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently.
Each project under the guidance of the CB must be represented equally in
membership. However, membership in this CB does not require affiliation with any
project. There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for CB
membership beyond these rules.

The CB may add additional members to the CB by majority vote. A CB member may be
removed from the CB by voluntary resignation, or by majority vote of all other
CB members.

Changes to CB membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be suggested as
any other agenda item (see "CB Meetings" below). If a membership change is
proposed during a meeting, and the full CB is not in attendance to participate,
then the change is added to the agenda for the subsequent meeting. This is to
ensure that all members are given the opportunity to participate in all
membership decisions. If a CB member is unable to attend a meeting where a
planned membership decision is being made, then their consent is assumed.

No more than one-third (1/3) of the CB members may be affiliated with the same
employer. If removal or resignation of a CB member, or a change of employment by
a CB member, creates a situation where more than 1/3 of the CB membership shares
an employer, then the situation must be immediately remedied by the resignation
or removal of one or more CB members affiliated with the over-represented
employer(s) or through the addition of one or more CB members not affiliated
with the over-represented employer(s).

### Meetings

The [JS Foundation Base Meetings Policy][] applies to this CB.

### Consensus Seeking Process

The [JS Foundation Base Consensus Seeking Process Policy][] applies to this
CB.

### Contribution Policy

The *[insert CB name]* GitHub repository is maintained by the CB. The Projects
under the guidance of this CB maintain their own GitHub repositories and
additional Collaborators are added by the Project Maintainers on an ongoing
basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made Collaborators
and given commit-access. These individuals are identified by the existing
Project Collaborators and their addition as

Collaborators is discussed during project meetings. The CB may make
recommendations for new Collaborators to Projects based on observations and
defined policies.

Modifications of the contents of the CB repository and its related Project
repositories are made on a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account
may propose a modification via pull request and it will be considered by the
Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a Collaborator
with sufficient expertise who is able to take full responsibility for the
change. In the case of pull requests proposed by an existing Collaborator, an
additional Collaborator is required for sign-off. Consensus should be sought if
additional Collaborators participate and there is disagreement around a
particular modification. See _Consensus Seeking Process_ above for further
detail on the consensus model used for governance.

Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial modifications, or
modifications that have not found consensus to the CB for discussion by
assigning the **CB-agenda** tag to a pull request or issue. The CB should serve
as the final arbiter where required.

### Moderation Policy

The [JS Foundation Moderation Policy][] applies to this CB and all Projects
under its guidance.

### Code of Conduct

The [JS Foundation Code of Conduct][] applies to this CB and all Projects
under its guidance.
