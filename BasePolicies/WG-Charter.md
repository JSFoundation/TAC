## Working Group Charter Template

Every Working Group (WG) requires a charter that describes the scope of the WG's
responsibilities, participating projects, goals and specific deliverable at the
close of the WG. Once written, new WGs send a Pull Request that adds the
charter to the Technical Advisory Committee's (TAC) WORKING_GROUPS.md. The WG is
considered to be officially chartered once the PR adding the proposed charter is
landed and merged into the relevant document.

### Template: *[insert WG name]*

*[Insert brief overview of WG and events leading to the formation of this WG and
*complete the following list of items]*

* **Collaborating Projects**
 * *[Project 1]*
 * *[Project 2]*
* **Deliverable**
 * *[Describe the deliverable of this WG]*
* **Roadmap**
 * *[High-level milestones with final delivery goal]*

### Membership

By default, all Maintainers for the Projects that form this WG will be
Maintainers for this WG and will compose the WG Membership. Additionally, all
current Collaborators will be considered Collaborators on the WG repository.
The Projects may decide to limit the membership to a subset of those Project
Maintainers or may create a new mutually agreeable set of Maintainers and/or
Collaborators from outside the current group of Collaborators. In the case that
the membership does not include the entire group of Maintainers from all
Projects involved or includes additional members, the list of members will be
made available in the WG's [README.md][].

Changes to WG membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be suggested as
any other agenda item (see "WG Meetings" below). If a membership change is
proposed during a meeting, and the full WG is not in attendance to participate,
then the change is added to the agenda for the subsequent meeting. This is to
ensure that all members are given the opportunity to participate in all
membership decisions. If a WG member is unable to attend a meeting where a
planned membership decision is being made, then their consent is assumed.

### Contribution Policy

The *[insert WG name]* GitHub repository is maintained by the WG membership.

Modifications of the contents of the WG repository are made on a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account
may propose a modification via pull request and it will be considered by the
Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a Collaborator
with sufficient expertise who is able to take full responsibility for the
change. In the case of pull requests proposed by an existing Collaborator, an
additional Collaborator is required for sign-off. Consensus should be sought if
additional Collaborators participate and there is disagreement around a
particular modification. See _Consensus Seeking Process_ above for further
detail on the consensus model used for governance.

All proposed changes to this charter or any other WG process or policy document
must be elevated to the WG for discussion before the change is accepted.
Collaborators may also opt to elevate significant or controversial modifications, or
modifications that have not found consensus to the WG for discussion by
assigning the **WG-agenda** tag to a pull request or issue. The WG should serve
as the final arbiter where required.
