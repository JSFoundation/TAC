## Collaboration Board and Working Group Moderation Policy Template

Every Collaboration Board (CB) and Working Group (WG) must have a Moderation
Policy. By default, all repositories under the jQuery Foundation owned GitHub
organizations fall under the [jQuery Foundation Moderation Policy][], but CBs,
WGs and other technical governing bodies can choose to define their own
alternative policy. If the governing body does choose it's own Moderation
Policy, it must be documented in a `ModerationPolicy.md` file located in the
root of any repository under their stewardship.

Note that the Moderation Policy adopted by a governing body will be evaluated by
the TAC prior to ratifying the proposed charter. If that Moderation Policy is
considered to be weaker than, or diverges too significantly from, the
[jQuery Foundation Moderation Policy][], the TAC may defer accepting the charter
until corrections are made.

Likewise, if the Moderation Policy changes after the CB or WG has already been
chartered and the TAC determines that the updated Moderation Policy is weaker
than, or diverges too significantly from, the
[jQuery Foundation Moderation Policy][], the TAC, CB or any Collaborator may
request that further corrections be made by opening an issue or a PR in the CB's
or WG's repository. Should the CB or WG choose not to adopt the recommended
changes, the CB's or WG's charter may be revoked.
