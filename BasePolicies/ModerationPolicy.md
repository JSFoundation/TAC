## Working Group Moderation Policy

Every Working Group (WG) must have a Moderation Policy. By default, all
repositories under the JS Foundation owned GitHub organizations fall under the
[JS Foundation Moderation Policy][], but WGs and other technical governing
bodies can choose to define their own alternative policy. If the governing body
does choose it's own Moderation Policy, it must be documented in a
`ModerationPolicy.md` file located in the root of any repository under their
stewardship.

Note that the Moderation Policy adopted by a governing body will be evaluated by
the TAC prior to ratifying the proposed charter. If that Moderation Policy is
considered to be weaker than, or diverges too significantly from, the
[JS Foundation Moderation Policy][], the TAC may defer accepting the charter
until corrections are made.

Likewise, if the Moderation Policy changes after the WG has already been
chartered and the TAC determines that the updated Moderation Policy is weaker
than, or diverges too significantly from, the
[JS Foundation Moderation Policy][], the TAC or any Collaborator may request
that further corrections be made by opening an issue or a PR in the WG's
repository. Should the WG choose not to adopt the recommended changes, the WG's
charter may be revoked.
