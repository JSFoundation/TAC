# Project description

ESLint is a JavaScript linting tool that audits code and reports problems that it finds. The tool is configurable to accommodate different programming styles and it is also configurable using third-party plugins.
 
# Project history

Nicholas Zakas started the ESLint project in 2013 in order to establish an extensible code auditing framework that used currently-available JavaScript parsers and provided an opportunity for users to create plugins representing personal or team preferences.

In April 2016, the JSCS team joined ESLint in a bid to consolidate auditing for both code bugs and code style into a single tool.

The ESLint project is currently a member of the JS Foundation by way of the jQuery Foundation. ESLint joined the jQuery Foundation in April 2016.

# Available metrics or estimates about the user base, ecosystem and community.

# Project scope

ESLint helps JavaScript developers write code that avoids common language pitfalls and follows style guidelines. Since ESLint is configurable and extendable, developers and/or development teams have a great deal of flexibility about which rules they want to enforce. This reduces the time spent on style issues during a code review.

# Current governance process --- (decision making process)

A Technical Steering Committee (TSC) determines the direction of the project at a high level and ensures that the project does regular releases, with the current cadence being every two weeks. Meeting notes are kept at [https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings). The current TSC is described at [https://github.com/eslint/eslint#technical-steering-committee-tsc](https://github.com/eslint/eslint#technical-steering-committee-tsc).
