# arc

> `arc` is a format for defining **cloud functions**, with tools to deploy, test, and manage them in a vendor-neutral way

- Version control your app architecture and generate cloud infrastructure in `.arc` text files
- Rapidly provision, deliver and deploy cloud functions
- Iterate faster with more frequent and lower-risk releases
- Ship with the confidence of cloud scalability, availability, and security
- Avoid vendor lock-in by focusing on application architecture instead of vendor infrastructure
 
`arc`’s text format and subsequent tooling is completely vendor neutral. Currently, arc only supports Amazon Web Services.

## History
 
In December 2015, we began development of begin.com, a productivity application and platform. Looking to the future, it seemed clear that the cloud was right way to deliver our software. Considering the state of the cloud in 2015, it was also very clear that functions as a service was going to become a very compelling development model.
 
We decided to completely adopt the cloud and functions as a service into our application architecture, estimating that during the expected timeline of our development, both would mature significantly and likely convey an advantage for getting to and competing in an already fiercely established market. 

The cloud brings significant advances to our ability to deliver software:

- 100% utilization: only pay for what you use
- Focus on your domain logic free of infrastructure scaling concerns
- Patches, backups, security, auditing, monitoring are all managed and improving
- Elastic availability of services is becoming a standard feature
- Zero downtime deploys 

Even with these benefits the cloud comes with unique problems. We found tooling in the cloud ecosystem to be largely immature, vendor specific, and, worse, too often closely emulating defunct server metaphors. In order to build our product, we eventually came to the determination that we needed tooling capable of addressing the specific kinds of problems a microservices style application architecture will inevitably surface. 

- AWS is massive and overwhelming with many similar, but not the same, products
- The web console is confusing with divergent interfaces between services
- Deep proprietary knowledge is required to configure raising the potential for lock-in
- Configuration and infrastructure can drift, leaving systems in difficult to repeat/reproduce and thus scale

We've tamed many of these problems with _infrastructure as code_ creating repeatable and reproducable systems. The tradeoff is you are committing aws configuration knowledge into your revision control systems. `.arc` views infrastructure as a build artifact. **And we do not recommend checking build artifacts into our code.**
 
Fast forward to June of 2017: begin.com is in alpha, and we’re in a position to share our experiences in building with *functions as a service*, and to open and donate our related tooling with the broader free/open source software developer community. We believe that architectural and infrastructure tooling should be open source for a host of reasons. It is proven that many eyeballs make bugs (and security holes) very shallow. A large community also brings the potential of cloud platform portability. However most importantly, philosophically we believe the existence of a devops focused, vendor-neutral *functions as a service* tooling solution, with open and transparent community governance, can be a rising tide that will lift all ships.
 
## Metrics
 
Some portions of what we’re now calling `arc` have been open source for a while. Our first foray is a simple wrapper library that has relatively small user base (which may be largely comprised of begin.com’s continuous integration systems).
 
- https://github.com/smallwins/lambda
- https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=%40smallwins%2Flambda
 
However, that effort taught us a lot about *functions as a service*, evolved our understanding and established the `.arc` solving real problems from direct experience. It’s very early days for the idea of _functions as a service_, and we believe the JS Foundation is the right place to grow this solution. 
 
### Ecosystem
 
The cloud ecosystem is very large and is growing fast. First-generation cloud solutions that use traditional server-based metaphors aren’t appropriate targets for `arc`, even if they offer elastic scaling of virtual machine instances based on demand (or orchestrate containers).
 
These types of solutions are anchored in an incompatible server metaphor and applying this abstraction would be leaky. 
 
The kinds of infrastructure solutions we believe would be better targets include:
 
- Amazon Web Services Lambdas
- Microsoft Azure Cloud Functions
- IBM OpenWhisk 
- Google Cloud Platform Cloud Functions
 
Other, possibly more interesting, but smaller vendors’ solutions include: 
 
- Stripe Runkit
- Twilio Functions
- stdlib.io
- iron.io
- webtask.io
 
Frameworks/tooling alternatives to `arc` include:
 
- Serverless Framework
- Terraform
- AWS SAM (Cloudformation™)
 
The developer community understands _open_ means *open governance*, and not just a LICENSE file on Github, which is why we believe this kind of tooling should not be tied to any one company.
 
## Project Scope

`arc` is a text format and collection of command line tools implemented in Node. 
 
- `.arc` - text format specification 
- `arc-parser` - parses `.arc` text format into a javascript object
- `arc-workflows` - npm script based workflows that act on a `.arc` file
- `arc-functions` - shims for the different types of Lambda functions supported: events, html, json, scheduled and tables
- `arc-data` - generates a DynamoDB data access layer from an `.arc` file
- `arc-docs` - docs in markdown 
- `arc.codes` - https://arc.codes (writ as an `.arc` app of course)

Possibly noticable in its absence is tooling for taking down generated deployment infrastructure. Nothing is ever destroyed programmically and things are only ever created by `arc-create` if they do not yet exist. Maybe in the future we will add destructive actions to make one off testing easier but so far a manually handling destructive actions has worked well enough for us. The  workflow ends up being incremental. You make small edits to `.arc` and `npm run create` to generate local code and remote infra as you go. 

Here is an example `.arc` file:

```bash
# arc manifest format supports comments
@app
hello-world  # an app name is required; it gets used for the generated infra

# routes will map to lambdas
@html
get /
get /hello
post /like

@json
get /api/likes
get /api/likes/:likeID
post /api/likes
post /api/likes/:likeID
post /api/likes/:likeID/delete # arc only supports get/post http verbs (like browsers!)

@events
hit-counter

@tables
likes
  likeID *String
```

`arc-create` is an installable npm script. Once in your project with `.arc` file above `npm run create` generates the following local code:

```
/
|-src
| |-html
| | |-get-index
| | |-get-hello
| | '-post-like
| |-json
| | |-get-api-likes
| | |-get-api-likes-000likeID
| | |-post-api-likes
| | |-post-api-likes-000likeID
| | '-post-api-likes-000likeID-delete
| '-events
|   '-hit-counter
|-.arc
'-package.json
```

`arc-create` also ensures the corosponding lambdas are created, endpoints wired, permissions set and immediately ready for deployment to two identical environments for `staging` and `production`. You can delete the infrastructure anytime and re-run `arc-create` to regenerate it from your local source. 

The `.arc` above generates the following infra:

##### API Gateway Invoked Lambdas

- `hello-world-staging-get-index`
- `hello-world-staging-get-hello`
- `hello-world-staging-post-like`
- `hello-world-production-get-index`
- `hello-world-production-get-hello`
- `hello-world-production-post-like`
- `hello-world-staging-get-api-likes`
- `hello-world-staging-get-api-likes-000likeID`
- `hello-world-staging-post-api-likes`
- `hello-world-staging-post-api-likes-000likeID`
- `hello-world-staging-post-api-likes-000likeID-delete`
- `hello-world-production-get-api-likes`
- `hello-world-production-get-api-likes-000likeID`
- `hello-world-production-post-api-likes`
- `hello-world-production-post-api-likes-000likeID`
- `hello-world-production-post-api-likes-000likeID-delete`

Remember, these lambdas are generated infrastructure and really just deployment targets for your code. `arc-deploy` deploys everything in `./src` to `staging` lambdas by default. (Deploying to `production` lambdas takes an extra step.) API Gateway based `@html` lambda route handlers work very similarily to Express. Responses can be one of `200`, `302`, `403`, `404` or `500` status codes. Sessions are supported by default. `@json` works the same (except `content-type` is `application/json` instead of `html/text`).
 
##### SNS Event Triggered Lambdas

- `hello-world-staging-hit-counter`
- `hello-world-production-hit-counter`

These lambdas are subscribed to a corosponding SNS topic that can be invoked by any other lambda programatically by publishing a JSON payload to that topic. Pub sub! (Which happens to be great for many things: from building bots to long running background tasks.)

##### DynamoDB Tables 

- `hello-world-staging-likes`
- `hello-world-producion-likes`
- `arc-staging-sessions`
- `arc-production-sessions`

> Additionally `.arc` supports DynamoDB table indexes and lambdas triggered by insert, update and delete events from generated tables.

---

This is getting a lot of finicky configuration work done very quickly. Initial creates of an entire stack can take a few minutes but subsequent deployments are in seconds with zero downtime. Isolation of the runtime infrastructure between `staging` and `production` makes deployment trivially automatable and worry free. Everything can be run offline for authortime speed. The architecture is safely revisioned in `.arc` and easily reproduced which can be helpful for deploying across availability zones or even for just spinning up a disposable demo version of an app. The `.arc` format itself is extremely terse, self documenting while remaining totally vendor neutral.
