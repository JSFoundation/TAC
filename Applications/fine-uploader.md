## Introduction and Project description

Fine Uploader is a unique JavaScript file upload library in that it has zero external dependencies yet includes a large number of features used to easily upload large files directly to Amazon's Simple Storage Service, Microsoft's Azure Cloud Storage service, or any other custom server endpoints. The Fine Uploader organization contains, in addition to the primary library, a popular React wrapper, a VueJS wrapper, a number of server-side examples, and many integrations. In total, the organization maintains 20 individual projects at this time. Throughout its 7-year existence, it has amassed a respectable following of users and integrations. I, Ray Nicholus, am personally submitting this application to the JS Foundation as the primary contributor and maintainer of the library since 2012.

## Project history

Fine Uploader has a long and interesting history. I took the time to explain this history in a very detailed Medium.com article at https://medium.com/@RayNicholus/disrupting-open-source-the-story-of-fine-uploader-80160eb557d9.

* GitHub watchers: 340
* npm downloads per month: ~19,000
* direct from GitHub downloads of v5.14.2 (released 16 days ago): ~1,800

## Project scope

The Fine Uploader organization focuses specifically on browser-side file manipulation, validation, and uploading. Some of the integrations take this a bit further, such as the [video-frame-uploader project](https://github.com/FineUploader/video-frame-uploader), which demonstrates how to use Fine Uploader to create and upload snapshots from HTML5 videos. The current version of Fine Uploader supports browsers all the way back to IE7 (technically) though v6.0.0 (not yet released) aims to remove some of this cruft and focus on modern browsers.

## Current governance process

None, at the moment - single dedicated maintainer only.

## Current contribution process

Pull-request based. I, the maintainer, review all PRs and merge appropriate updates after a code review, assuming tests and documentation is included.
