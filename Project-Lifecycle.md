# jQuery Foundation Project Lifecycle

## Project Definition

The jQuery Foundation hosts several Projects. These Projects are autonomous from
each other. Projects are governed by their Collaboration Board (CB) which are
chartered by the jQuery Foundation Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), their
Maintainers, or by another leadership structure as defined in their governance
policies. The TAC also charters its own Working Groups for Foundation-wide
and/or cross-CB and cross-Project initiatives.

CBs may nominate a representative to be elected to the TAC. CBs with
*mentorship* status are not granted a seat on the TAC until they have graduated
from the mentorship program.

## Mentorship

The purpose of mentorship is to support and mentor projects entering the
Foundation. The goal is for projects to be:

* Participatory
* Transparent
* Effective

While certain processes are strongly recommended based on the experiences of the
Foundation and its Projects, the goal of mentorship is not to enforce a specific
set of processes but to ensure that the processes adopted and accepted by a
project achieve these goals. Therefore, the requirements for graduating from
mentorship are based on metrics that demonstrate success in terms of these
values. These metrics are:

* CB or other defined governing body is 5 members or greater and the governing
body must have at least 1 representative from each Project when multiple
projects are represented.
* No more than 1/3 of the CB or other defined governing body is affiliated with
the same employer.
* No more than 1/3 of any Project is affiliated with the same employer.
* The decision making and release process is documented and publicly accessible.
* Other metrics as defined by the applying Project during the application
process

A CB and its Projects may apply to graduate from mentorship at any time by
calling for a vote in the TAC.

While a Project is under mentorship, it is assigned at least 2 [mentors][] who
are responsible for working with the Project to adopt policies and gain the
health and contributorship it will need in order to graduate from mentorship.
The mentor list is nominated and approved by the TAC and may be larger than the
TAC.

## Lifecycle

The Foundation shall encourage new Projects and innovation in the community. New
Projects enter the jQuery Foundation through a [Proposal][].

The Project should be considered mature and have a history of releases before
applying to enter the Foundation. Exceptions may be made to this rule for
younger projects that have shown potential or have been created in response to
existing Foundation goals on a case-by-case basis at the TAC's discretion.

## CB and Working Group Requirements

All CBs, WGs and other project level governing bodies, are expected to operate
in a transparent manner. Decisions must be made publicly through a documented
public process managed by each and each governing body must use a participatory
decision making process.

### Security

All Projects in the Foundation share the same base security policy. The
Foundation's security team triages issues sent to security@jquery.org.

## Decision Making Process

All CBs, WGs and other project level governing bodies must follow a
[Consensus Seeking][] process and are responsible for documenting and keeping up
to date their current processes and practices.

Each Project may nominate a representative for election to the jQuery Foundation
TAC or vote to abstain from representation on the TAC.

## Applying to join

A proposal to join the jQuery Foundation as a Project or Working Group must
include:

* Introduction and Project description.
* Project history.
* Any available metrics or even estimates about the user base, ecosystem
and community.
* Project scope.
* Current governance process.
* Current contribution process.
* List of current tools in use by the project (forums, issue trackers,
  GitHub orgs, etc).
* Existing IP Policy and relevant intellectual property (trademarks,
  domain names, etc).
* List of initial Project Collaborators and Maintainers.
* List of potential CB member(s) if forming or joining an existing CB.
* List of initial Working Groups, if any.
* Prior to being admitted, the project must include:
 * [CLA][]
 * an [approved license][]. If it is not currently under an approved license, it
 will need to be cleared by the TAC and the jQuery Foundation Legal Committee or
 Board of Directors prior to acceptance into the mentorship program.
 * a [Code of Conduct][].

Each proposal should be sent as a pull request to this repository in the
Applications directory. Proposals do not have to be complete to be submitted,
the TAC can work with the authors and their respective communities in each pull
request.

### Approved Licenses

At this time, the Foundation's approved licenses include MIT, BSD, ISC or
Apache2. Other licenses may be accepted on a case-by-case basis.

### Admittance

The jQuery Foundation selects Projects for admission as mentors become
available.

You may apply at any time and the TAC and available mentors will help improve
your application while awaiting the next available approval phase.
